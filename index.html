        Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the 
        existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so 
        uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist 
          named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed
          up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
          physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered 
          what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the 
          presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special 
          energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the 
          speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
          uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning 
          would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, 
          but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double 
          box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
          the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as 
          inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a href="#">first sliver of cosmic time</a> 
          with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
          Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
          space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being 
          wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a 
          trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of 
          inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct

        <p>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, 
          including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable 
          to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang 
          itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and 
          speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
          light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an 
          infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are 
          unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
          other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
